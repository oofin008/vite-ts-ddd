- add `path` and `Component` in `src/routes`
- Note: add path before '*' path

- in `<Menu />` Component, add new item

- If want to connect to firebase on cloud, comment out connectEmulator code in `src/core/data/auth/firebaseApp.ts`


# ENV File
Env Loading Priorities
An env file for a specific mode (e.g. .env.production) will take higher priority than a generic one (e.g. .env).
In addition, environment variables that already exist when Vite is executed have the highest priority and will not be overwritten by .env files. For example, when running VITE_SOME_KEY=123 vite build.
.env files are loaded at the start of Vite. Restart the server after making changes.
